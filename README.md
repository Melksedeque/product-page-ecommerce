## Overview

This projet is a product page based on a FrontEnd Mentor Challenge. The main function is to simulate a product page with add to cart and delete from cart.

This project features an interactive product page developed with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to view product details, add it to the shopping cart, and remove products from the cart. The total cart price is dynamically calculated based on the quantity of products selected and the unit price of each item.

### Functionalities

- View product details including image, name, description and unit price.
- Adding products to the shopping cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button.
- Removing products from the shopping cart with the "Remove" button in the list of products in the cart.
- Automatic calculation of total cart price as products are added or removed.
- Visual feedback for the user, showing the number of products in the cart.
- Responsive user interface that adapts to different screen sizes.

### How to use

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
3. Explore the product page and try out the features for adding and removing products from the cart.

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this e-commerce product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it
